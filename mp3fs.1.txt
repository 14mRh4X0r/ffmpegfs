NAME
----
mp3fs - mounts and transcodes a multitude of formats like FLACs or OGGs 
to MP3s or MP4s on the fly


SYNOPSIS
--------
*mp3fs* ['OPTION']... 'IN_DIR' 'OUT_DIR'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The mp3fs(1) command will mount the directory 'IN_DIR' on 'OUT_DIR'.
Thereafter, accessing 'OUT_DIR' will show the contents of 'IN_DIR', with
all supported media files transparently renamed and transcoded to MP3/MP4
format upon access.


OPTIONS
-------

If the following options are capitalised or max** is used, they set 
maximum values for the respective option. This is the preferred selection 
as it increases the probability that no recoding takes place if input and 
output codecs match, resulting in faster processing.

*-W -omaxwidth*='WIDTH'::
    Set the maximum video width. If the source video width is higher,
    it will be sized down. If it is lower, it will be left unchanged.
*-w -owidth*='WIDTH'::
    Set the video width. If the source video width is higher, it will 
    be sized down. If it is lower, it will sized up.
*-H -omaxheight*='HEIGHT'::
    Set the maximum video height. If the source video height is higher,
    it will be sized down. If it is lower, it will be left unchanged.
*-h -oheight*='HEIGHT'::
    Set the video height. If the source video height is higher, it will 
    be sized down. If it is lower, it will sized up.
*-B, -omaxbitrate*='RATE'::
    Set the maximum bitrate to use for encoding. 
*-b, -obitrate*='RATE'::
    Set the bitrate to use for encoding.
+
Acceptable values for 'RATE':
+
*MP4 audio:*
+    
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 224, 
256, 288, 320, 352, 384, 416 and 448.
+    
*MP4 video*
+    
500 - 25000 (kbit)
+    
*MP3 audio:*
+
For sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 32,
40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, and 320.
+
For sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05, and 24 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 8,
16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160.
+
When in doubt, it is recommended to choose a bitrate among 96, 112, 128,
160, 192, 224, 256, and 320. If not specified, 'RATE' defaults to 128.

*-d, -odebug*::
    Enable debug output. This will result in a large quantity of
    diagnostic information being printed to stderr as the program runs.
    This option will normally not be used. It implies *-f*.

*-f*::
    Run in foreground instead of detaching from the terminal.

*-h, --help*::
    Print usage information.

*--quality, -oquality*='QUALITY'::
    Set quality for encoding, as understood by LAME. The slowest and best
    quality is 0, while 9 is the fastest and worst quality. The default
    value is 5, although according to the LAME manual, 2 is recommended.

*-s*::
    Force single-threaded operation.

*-V, --version*::
    Output version information.
