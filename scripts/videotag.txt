videotag.php is a small script that allows testing the video tag easily. Just put it into the base path directory, mount it to a folder that is accessible to your (PHP enabled) web server.

When the page is opened, all transcoded files are listed on the right and playback can be started by clicking on the link.

Very handy to test browser capabilities...
