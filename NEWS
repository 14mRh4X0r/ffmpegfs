Important changes in 0.91-FFMPEG (2017-10-04)

Added FFMPEG for decoding and encoding. 

Changes in this release:
* Replaced decoding and encoding by FFMPEG.
* Removed discrete FLAC/Ogg/MP3 libraries. FFMPEG supports a wide range of
  formats, including these, so they are no longer required.
* TODO: Supports a huge number of file formats now (run "mp3fs --codecs" for 
  a list).
* The standard target format is mp4 now (use "-o mp3" or "--output mp3"
  to change back to mp3).
* Many other formats are possible, e.g. "-o ogg", they will be added later
  because due to the manner in which Fuse requires access to the files they
  need to be implemented with care.
* See manual or run "mp3fs -h" for even more new options.
* Run "mp3fs -f" to get a list of all supported input formats.
* Caching of file attributes is now the default as if
  "--statcachesize=500" was given. Add "--statcachesize=0" to turn off
  (not really a bright idea, though).
* TODO: Files will now be decoded to /tmp/ instead of memory if large
  than 100MB. Add "--maxmemcache=X" to change. Examples for X: 80000,
  80MB or 1GB. Do not set to a too large value as you may run out of
  memory.
* : Support for video files.
* TODO: Add intelligent stream copy, e.g., if transcoding a transport stream
  that already represents a H264 video stream it would be possible to 
  simply repackage it to a mp4 container without recoding.

Important changes in 0.91 (2014-05-14)

This is mainly bug fixes.

Changes in this release:
* Fixed a segfault caused by an overflow reading the list of available
  decoders.
* A number of problems with the previous distribution tar are now fixed.
* The output of `mp3fs --version` has been made more complete.

Important changes in 0.9 (2014-04-06)

This is a major new release, and brings us very close to a 1.0 release!

Changes in this release:
* All transcoding code has been completely rewritten. Encoding and
  decoding have been abstracted out into base classes defining interfaces
  that can be implemented by different codec classes, with just a FLAC
  decoder and MP3 encoder at the moment.
* The build system has been modified as well to support this usage.
* A number of small bugs or code inefficiencies have been fixed.

Important changes in 0.32 (2012-06-18)

This release has a lot of bug fixes and some code cleanup.

Changes in this release:
* The file size calculation should always be correct.
* A crash affecting programs like scp that might try to access past the
  end of the file has been fixed.
* Too many other little fixes were made to list here. See the ChangeLog
  for full details.

Important changes in 0.31 (2011-12-04)

This is a minor update, with bug fixes and a new feature.

Changes in this release:
* The ReplayGain support added earlier now can be configured through the
  command line.
* Filename translation (from .flac to .mp3) is now fixed on filesystems
  such as XFS that do not populate dirent.d_type.
* A couple other minor bugs fixes and changes were made.

Important changes in 0.30 (2010-12-01)

This is a major new release, and brings mp3fs much closer to an eventual
1.0 release.

Changes in this release:
* Support for additional metadata tags has been added. (From Gregor
  Zurowski)
* Documentation improvements: the help message is more useful, and a man
  page has been added.
* Choosing bitrate is now done with a command-line or mount option, rather
  than the old comma syntax.
* A new option to select LAME encoding quality is now available. (From
  Gregor Zurowski)
* Debug output can be enabled at runtime.
* Old external libraries included in distribution (StringIO, talloc) have
  been removed and replaced.
* Numerous bug fixes have been made. (Some from Gregor Zurowski)
