Important changes in 0.30 (2010-12-01)

This is a major new release, and brings mp3fs much closer to an eventual
1.0 release.

Changes in this release:
* Support for additional metadata tags has been added. (From Gregor
  Zurowski)
* Documentation improvements: the help message is more useful, and a man
  page has been added.
* Choosing bitrate is now done with a command-line or mount option, rather
  than the old comma syntax.
* A new option to select LAME encoding quality is now available. (From
  Gregor Zurowski)
* Debug output can be enabled at runtime.
* Old external libraries included in distribution (StringIO, talloc) have
  been removed and replaced.
* Numerous bug fixes have been made. (Some from Gregor Zurowski)
