mp3fs - A transcoding FUSE filesystem

Prerequisites
=============

mp3fs requires the following libraries

fuse (>= 2.6.0)
flac (>= 1.1.4)
lame
libid3tag

If you are on Debian lenny or newer and have Debian-multimedia set up, you
can install these with:

aptitude install libfuse-dev libflac-dev libmp3lame-dev libid3tag0-dev

If you are using a Mac and have installed MacPorts you can install with:

port install macfuse flac lame libid3tag

On a rpm based system, if a repository that includes lame has been set up,
you can install by running:

yum install fuse-devel flac-devel lame-devel libid3tag-devel

Unfortunately, many rpm systems (CentOS for example) have very old
versions of flac that do not meet the requirements above. These versions
are only supported on the legacy (0.1x) versions of mp3fs.

Installation
============

mp3fs uses the GNU build system. To build and install, run:

./configure
make
make install
