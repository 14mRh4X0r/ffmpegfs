ffmpegfs TODOs

* Bugfix: Fix sharing problems with sqlite database when accessed by multiple instances.
* Fix deprecation: 2016-04-21 - 7fc329e - lavc 57.37.100 - avcodec.h
    Add a new audio/video encoding and decoding API with decoupled input
    and output -- avcodec_send_packet(), avcodec_receive_frame(),
    avcodec_send_frame() and avcodec_receive_packet().
* Fix deprecation: 2017-xx-xx - xxxxxxx - lavr 4.0.0 - avresample.h
    Deprecate the entire library. Merged years ago to provide compatibility
    with Libav, it remained unmaintained by the FFmpeg project and duplicated
    functionality provided by libswresample.
* Fix deprecation: av_iformat_next/av_oformat_next() lack a replacement (currently
    still used in tools/probetest.c "static void probe" in 58.10.100)

* Add intelligent stream copy, e.g., if transcoding a transport stream
  that already represents a H264 video stream it would be possible to
  simply repackage it to a mp4 container without recoding.
* Add option to deinterlace video if required (will improve picture
  quality when view in browsers via HTML5.
* Improve Libav compatibility (maybe it is possible to use Libav 11+?).
* Add album art support.
* Improve recoding detection. Currently a file is recoded if the source
  file size or timestamp changes, but not if different encoding options
  are selected (e.g. a different bitrate).
* DVD support: Detect IFO files and list separate DVD chapters or programs
  as separate files. Currently VOB files will be transcodes as is not
  allowing to access anything reasonable without seeking the stream.
* Bluray support: Similar to DVD support - split into chapters or programs.
* Many more ideas I'll have when I wake up and find them nice to have.
* Any features that you may request.
