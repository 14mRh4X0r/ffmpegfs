ffmpegfs TODOs

* Fix deprecation: av_iformat_next/av_oformat_next() lack a replacement (currently
    still used in tools/probetest.c "static void probe" in 58.10.100)

* Add intelligent stream copy, e.g., if transcoding a transport stream
  that already represents a H264 video stream it would be possible to
  simply repackage it to a mp4 container without recoding.
* Improve Libav compatibility (maybe it is possible to use Libav 11+?).
* Add album art support.
* DVD support: Detect IFO files and list separate DVD chapters or programs
  as separate files. Currently VOB files will be transcodes as is not
  allowing to access anything reasonable without seeking the stream.
* Bluray support: Similar to DVD support - split into chapters or programs.
* Allow WEBM output format.
* Many more ideas I'll have when I wake up and find them nice to have.
* Any features that you may request.

Optimisations

Currently playback is OK only with Firefox and MS Edge if running under Windows 10.
Under Linux Firefox works smoothly while under Windows 7 it sometimes has problems.
Why this works under some Windows 7 systems, but under others not is yet unclear.

Details:

Firefox OK for Linux and Windows 10. Audio plays fine under Windows 7, but videos
have sound and black picture or video does not play at all.

MS Edge is OK but of course under Windows 10 only.

MS Internet Explorer 11 works when switched to profile baseline 3.0 or high 3.1,
but video must be decoded as a whole first. No immediate start. If video is
fragmented, Internet Explorer plays the first segment and stops. If the ultrafast
option is not turned off (this implies constrained baseline profile)the video
won't play at all ("unsupported format").

Chrome works but the video must be decoded as a whole first.

Safari and Maxthon tests will follow.
