ffmpegfs TODOs

* Add intelligent stream copy, e.g., if transcoding a transport stream
  that already represents a H264 video stream it would be possible to
  simply repackage it to a mp4 container without recoding.
* Convert audio-only files to WAV or AIFF
* Convert video-only and audio-video files to MOV
* Vcodec copy and acodec copy if supported by MOV
* Transcode to vcodec prores if video source codec not supported by MOV
* Transcode to acodec pcm if audio source codec not supported by MOV.
* Improve Libav compatibility (maybe it is possible to use Libav 11+?).
* Many more ideas I'll have when I wake up and find them nice to have.
* Any features that you may request.
