ffmpegfs TODOs

* Fix deprecation: av_iformat_next/av_oformat_next() lack a replacement (currently
    still used in tools/probetest.c "static void probe" in 58.10.100)

* Add intelligent stream copy, e.g., if transcoding a transport stream
  that already represents a H264 video stream it would be possible to
  simply repackage it to a mp4 container without recoding.
* Improve Libav compatibility (maybe it is possible to use Libav 11+?).
* Add album art support.
* Improve recoding detection. Currently a file is recoded if the source
  file size or timestamp changes, but not if different encoding options
  are selected (e.g. a different bitrate).
* DVD support: Detect IFO files and list separate DVD chapters or programs
  as separate files. Currently VOB files will be transcodes as is not
  allowing to access anything reasonable without seeking the stream.
* Bluray support: Similar to DVD support - split into chapters or programs.
* Allow WEBM output format.
* Many more ideas I'll have when I wake up and find them nice to have.
* Any features that you may request.
